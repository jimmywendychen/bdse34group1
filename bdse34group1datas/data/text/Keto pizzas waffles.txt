4 large Eggs 
4 tbsp. Parmesan Cheese

3 oz. Cheddar Cheese 
14 slices Pepperoni (optional)
Method:
STEP 1
Add all ingredients (except for tomato sauce and cheese) to a container.
STEP 2
Use an immersion blender to blend everything together. About 30-45 seconds until the mixture thickens.
STEP 3
Heat your waffle iron and add half of the mixture to the waffle iron.
STEP 4
Let cook until there is little steam coming out of the waffle iron. Once done, remove from the iron and repeat with the second half of the mixture.

Add tomato sauce (1/4 cup per waffle), and cheese (1.5 oz. per waffle) on the top of each waffle. Then, broil for 3-5 minutes in the oven. Optionally add pepperoni to the top of these.
STEP 6
Once the cheese is melted and starting to crisp on top, remove from the oven and serve.
