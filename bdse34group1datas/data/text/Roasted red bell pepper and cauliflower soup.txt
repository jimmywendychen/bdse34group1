Roasted red bell pepper and cauliflower soup 
Ingredients:
2 medium Red Bell Peppers, cut in half and de-seeded
1/2 head Cauliflower, cut into florets
2 tbsp. Duck Fat
3 medium Green Onions, diced
3 cups Chicken Broth
1/2 cup Heavy Cream
4 tbsp. Duck Fat
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
1 tsp. Dried Thyme
1 tsp. Smoked Paprika
1/4 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes
4 oz. Goat Cheese, crumbled (to top)
Salt and Pepper to Taste 
Method:
STEP 1
Put oven on broil setting. Slice peppers in half and de-seed them. Lay them skin side up on a foil-covered baking tray and broil for 10-15 minutes or until skin is charred and blackened. 
STEP 2
While peppers are broiling, cut cauliflower into florets. If the florets are large, cut florets in half or quarters. 
STEP 3
Once peppers are done, remove from oven and place in a container with a lid, or a food saver bag and seal. Let the peppers steam and cook longer to soften while cauliflower roasts. 
STEP 4
Use 2 tbsp. melted duck fat, salt, and pepper to season the cauliflower. Roast cauliflower in 400F oven for 30-35 minutes. 
STEP 5
Remove the skins from the peppers by peeling it off carefully. 
STEP 6
In a pot, bring 4 tbsp. duck fat to heat and add diced green onion. Once green onion is slightly cooked, add seasonings into the pan to toast. 
STEP 7
Add chicken broth, red pepper, and cauliflower to the pan. Let this simmer for 10-20 minutes. 
STEP 8
Take an immersion blender to the mixture. Make sure that all fats are emulsified with the mixture by the time you’re finished – about 1-2 minutes. Season to taste, then add cream and mix.
STEP 9
Serve with some crispy bacon and goats cheese. Garnish with extra thyme and green onion.
