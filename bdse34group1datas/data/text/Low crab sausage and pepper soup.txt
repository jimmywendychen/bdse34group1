Low crab sausage and pepper soup 
Ingredients:
32 oz. Pork Sausage
1 tbsp. Olive Oil
10 oz. Raw Spinach
1 medium Green Bell Pepper
1 can Tomatoes w/Jalapenos
4 cups Beef Stock
1 tsp. Onion Powder
1 tbsp. Chili powder
1 tbsp. Cumin
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
1 tsp. Italian Seasoning
3/4 tsp. Kosher Salt
Method:
STEP 1
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add sausage to the pan.
STEP 2
Once the sausage is seared on one side, mix it together to allow it to cook slightly.
STEP 3
As the sausage cooks, slice green pepper into pieces. I optionally add 1 jalapeno more because I prefer the spiciness of fresh jalapeno.
STEP 4
Add the peppers and stir everything together well. Season with salt and pepper.
STEP 5
Add the tomatoes and jalapenos from the can and stir once more.
STEP 6
Then, add the spinach on top of everything and place the lid on the pot.
STEP 7
Cook until spinach is wilted, about 6-7 minutes.
STEP 8
In the meantime, measure out all spices and grab your beef stock to have handy.
STEP 9
Once the spinach is wilted, mix it together with the sausage. Then add the spices and mix again. Lastly, add the broth and mix once again.
STEP 10
Replace the lid and cook for 30 minutes covered, reducing heat to medium-low.
STEP 11
Remove the lid from the pan and let simmer for 15 minutes longer.
