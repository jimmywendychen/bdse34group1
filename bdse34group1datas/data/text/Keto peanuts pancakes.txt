Method:
STEP 1
To prepare the peanut filling from scratch, roast 1.8 oz. Freshly Shelled Peanuts until brown.
STEP 2
Grind the peanuts, 1/2 tsp. Stevia and Salt to taste with a pestle and mortar (or alternatively food processor). Set aside.
STEP 3
To prepare Keto Condensed Milk, heat up 1/4 cup Heavy Cream in a saucepan with 2 drops Liquid Sucralose to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer. It should thicken up like condensed milk consistency. Let cool and set aside.

In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup Almond Flour, 1/2 tsp. Baking Soda, 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder and 1/8 tsp. Salt.
STEP 5
Add in 1/4 cup Almond Milk, 1 large Egg, 5 drops Liquid Sucralose and 1/2 tsp. Coconut oil and mix well.
STEP 6
In a small pan on medium heat, melt and spread 1/8 tsp. (per pancake) Coconut Oil. Once hot, pour half of the mixture and cover the pan.
STEP 7
After 1 minute and the pancake is half-cooked, sprinkle half of the peanut filling.
STEP 8
Spread half of the keto condensed milk onto one half of the pancake and butter onto the other half. Cover the pan once more for a few minutes.
STEP 9
Once the side is browned, remove the pancake and let cool.
STEP 10
Repeat steps 6-9 for the other pancake. Once cooled, fold the pancakes and slice to bite-sized pieces. Serve!
