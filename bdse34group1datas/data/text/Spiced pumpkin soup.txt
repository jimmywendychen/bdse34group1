Spiced pumpkin soup
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Chicken Broth
1 cup Pumpkin Puree
4 tbsp. Butter
1/4 medium Onion, chopped
2 cloves Roasted Garlic, minced (recipe here)
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
1/2 tsp. Freshly Minced
Ginger
1/4 tsp. Cinnamon
1/4 tsp. Coriander
1/8 tsp. Nutmeg
1 Bay Leaf
1/2 cup Heavy Cream
4 slices Bacon
~3 tbsp. Leftover Bacon Grease (from the bacon)
Optional:
Freshly Grated Parmesan
2 tbsp. Sour Cream (per serving)
Method:
STEP 1
In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, add butter and let it melt completely. You want it to darken into a golden color.
STEP 2
Dice the 1/4 medium, mince the 2 cloves of roasted garlic, and mince 1/2 tsp. fresh ginger.
STEP 3
In a small container, mix together all of your spices so you have them together. 1/2 tsp. Salt, 1/2 tsp. Pepper, 1/2 tsp. Freshly Minced Ginger, 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. Coriander, 1/8 tsp. Nutmeg, and 1 Bay Leaf.
STEP 4
Once the butter has turned a dark golden color, add onion, garlic, and ginger to the pan and stir well. Let this saute for about 2-3 minutes or until onions start to go translucent.
STEP 5
Measure out 1 cup of pumpkin puree and set aside.
STEP 6
Once onions are translucent, add spices to the pan and let cook for 1-2 minutes.
STEP 7
Add pumpkin puree to pan and stir into the onions and spices well.
STEP 8
Once the pumpkin is mixed well, add 1 1/2 cup chicken broth to the pan. Stir until everything is combined.
STEP 9
Bring to a boil and then turn to low, let this simmer for 20 minutes.
STEP 10
Once simmered, use an immersion blender to blend together all of the ingredients. You want a smooth puree here so make sure you take your time. Cook for an additional 20 minutes.
STEP 11
In the mean time, cook 4 slices of bacon over medium heat. Use a grease catcher to keep the mess off of your stove-top.
STEP 12
Once the soup is ready, pour in 1/2 cup heavy cream and the grease from the cooked bacon (this should be around 3 tbsp.) mix well.
STEP 13
Crumble the bacon over the top of the soup. Optional: Serve with chopper parsley and 2 tbsp. sour cream.
