Keto pumpkin bread loaf 
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup Almond Flour
3 large Egg Whites
1/2 cup Pumpkin Puree
1/2 cup Coconut Milk(from the carton)
1/4 cup Psyllium Husk Powder
1/4 cup Swerve Sweetener
2 tsp. Baking Powder
1 1/2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice
1/2 tsp. Kosher Salt
Method:
STEP 1
Measure out all dry ingredients into a sifter. If you don’t have a sifter, you can grab one on the cheap from Amazon.
STEP 2
Sift all ingredients into a large bowl. Preheat your oven to 350F. Fill a 9×9 baking dish with about 1 cup of water and place on the bottom rack of the oven.
STEP 3
Add pumpkin puree and coconut milk and mix together well. You should have a pretty resistant dough by the time you finish mixing.
STEP 4
Whip the egg whites in a second bowl. If needed, add some cream of tartar to the egg whites to keep them stable.
STEP 5
Aggressively fold in 1/3 of the egg whites to the dough so that some of the moisture is absorbed. Then, add the rest of the egg whites and gently fold into the dough.
STEP 6
Grease a standard bread loaf pan well (with either butter or coconut oil). Then, spread the dough into the bread pan.
STEP 7
Bake the bread for 75 minutes. Optionally add 1/4 cup pistachios (I prefer it without the pistachios, so I left them out of the recipe).
STEP 8
Remove loaf from the oven and let cool.
STEP 9
Slice and serve!
