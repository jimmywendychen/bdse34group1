Nacho chicken casserole 
Ingredients:
1.75 lbs. Chicken Thighs, boneless skinless
1 1/2 tsp. Chili seasoning
2 tbsp. Olive Oil
4 oz. Cream Cheese
4 oz. Cheddar Cheese
1 cup Green Chilies and Tomatoes
3 tbsp. Parmesan Cheese (~45g)
1/4 cup Sour Cream
16 oz. package Frozen Cauliflower
1 medium Jalapeno Pepper
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Pre-heat oven to 375F. Using kitchen shears, chop chicken into bite-size chunks. Season chicken with salt, pepper, and chili seasoning. 
STEP 2
Over medium-high heat, cook chicken in olive oil until browned on all sides.
STEP 3
Add cream cheese, sour cream and 3/4 of the cheddar cheese to the chicken, then stir together until melted and mixed. Add tomatoes and green chili and mix well.
STEP 4
In a casserole dish, add chicken mixture from the pan.
STEP 5
Microwave frozen cauliflower until cooked through. Use an immersion blender to blend with remaining cheese into a mashed potato-like consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
STEP 6
Cut a jalapeno into chunks. Spread cauliflower mixture over the top of the casserole, then sprinkle jalapeno pepper over the top. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until some color is on the top and the jalapenos are cooked.
STEP 7
Slice and serve. Some fresh chopped cilantro tastes great over the top!
