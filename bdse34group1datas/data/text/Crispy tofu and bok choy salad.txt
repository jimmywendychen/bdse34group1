Crispy tofu and bok choy salad
Ingredients:
Oven Baked Tofu
15 oz. Extra Firm Tofu
1 tbsp. Soy Sauce
1 tbsp. Sesame Oil
1 tbsp. Water
2 tsp. Minced Garlic
1 tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar
Juice 1/2 Lemon
Bok Choy Salad
9 oz. Bok Choy
1 stalk Green Onion
2 tbsp. Cilantro, chopped
3 tbsp. Coconut Oil
2 tbsp. Soy Sauce
1 tbsp. Sambal Olek
1 tbsp. Peanut Butter
Juice 1/2 lime
7 drops Liquid Stevia
Method:
STEP 1
Start by pressing the tofu. Lay the tofu in a kitchen towel and put something heavy over the top (like a cast iron skillet). It takes about 4-6 hours to dry out, and you may need to replace the kitchen towel half-way through.
STEP 2
Once the tofu is pressed, work on your marinade. Combine all of the ingredients for the marinade (soy sauce, sesame oil, water, garlic, vinegar, and lemon).
STEP 3
Chop the tofu into squares and place in a plastic bag along with the marinade. Let this marinate for at least 30 minutes, but preferably overnight.
STEP 4
Pre-heat oven to 350F. Place tofu on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (or a silpat) and bake for 30-35 minutes.
STEP 5
As the tofu is cooked, get started on the bok choy salad. Chop cilantro and spring onion.
STEP 6
Mix all of the other ingredients together (except lime juice and bok choy) in a bowl. Then add cilantro and spring onion. Note: You can microwave coconut oil for 10-15 seconds to allow it to melt.
STEP 7
Once the tofu is almost cooked, add lime juice into the salad dressing and mix together.
STEP 8
Chop the bok choy into small slices, like you would cabbage.
STEP 9
Remove the tofu from the oven and assemble your salad with tofu, bok choy, and sauce. Enjoy!
