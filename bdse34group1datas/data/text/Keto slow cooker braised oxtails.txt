Keto slow cooker braised oxtails 
Ingredients:
2 lbs. Oxtails (Bone-in)
2 cups Beef Broth
1/3 cup Butter
2 tbsp. Soy Sauce
1 tbsp. Fish Sauce
3 tbsp. Tomato Paste
1 tsp. Onion Powder
1 tsp. Minced Garlic
1/2 tsp. Ground Ginger
1 tsp. Dried Thyme
Salt and Pepper to Taste
1/2 tsp. Guar Gum
Method:
STEP 1
Heat up the beef broth on the stove and mix in the soy sauce, fish sauce, tomato paste, and butter. Transfer to the slow cooker once mixed together and hot, then place the oxtails inside as well.
STEP 2
Season the oxtails and broth with onion powder, minced garlic, ground ginger, dried thyme, and salt and pepper to taste.
STEP 3
That’s it! Set it and forget it: Cook on low for 6-7 hours.
STEP 4
Once cooked, remove the oxtail from the slow cooker and set aside on paper towels to drain (if you are going to serve them dry).
STEP 5
Using an immersion blender, blend together the leftover juices in the slow cooker. Add 1/2 tsp. Guar Gum while blending to make a cohesive and thickened gravy.
STEP 6
Enjoy! Serve with Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes or your favorite fatty side dish with gravy on top.
