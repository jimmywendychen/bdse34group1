Keto grilled cheese sandwich 
Ingredients:
Bun Ingredients
2 large Eggs
2 tbsp. Almond Flour
1 1/2 tbsp. Psyllium Husk
Powder
1/2 tsp. Baking Powder
2 tbsp. Soft Butter
Fillings & Extras
2 oz. Cheddar Cheese (or white cheddar, if you’re feeling frisky)
1 tbsp. Butter, for frying
Method:
STEP 1
Let 2 tbsp. butter come to room temperature in a mug. Once it’s soft, add 2 tbsp. Almond Flour, 1 1/2 tbsp. Psyllium Husk, and 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder.
STEP 2
Mix this together as well as you can so that a thick dough is formed.
STEP 3
Add 2 large eggs and continue mixing together. You want a dough that is pretty thick. If your dough isn’t thick, continue mixing the dough – it will thicken up as you mix it (this can take up to 60 seconds).
STEP 4
Pour the dough into a square container or bowl. Level it off and clean off the sides that that it comes out as level as you can get it.
STEP 5
Microwave for about 90-100 seconds. You will have to check the doneness of it to make sure it doesn’t need longer.
STEP 6
Remove from the container or bowl by flipping it upside down and lightly tapping the bottom. Cut it in half using a bread knife.
STEP 7
Measure out the cheese you can and stick it between the buns.
STEP 8
Bring 1 tbsp. butter to heat in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add bun and allow to cook in the butter. This should be absorbed by the bread as you cook and give a delicious, crisp outside.
STEP 9
Serve up with a side salad for some delicious ooey-gooey grilled cheese!
