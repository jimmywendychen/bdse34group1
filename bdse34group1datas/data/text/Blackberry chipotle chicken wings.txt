Blackberry chipotle chicken wings
Ingredients:
3 lbs. Chicken Wings (~20 wings, butchered)
1/2 cup Blackberry Chipotle Jam 
1/2 cup Water
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Start by butchering the chicken wings. Place the chicken wing down on a cutting board and let the “V” naturally occur. Cut into the V, allowing your knife to do most of the work. You should only be cutting through cartilage, and not bone.
STEP 2
Once you have the drummette detached from the wing, locate the secondary ”V” that occurs between the wing and the wing tip. Use the weight of your knife to cut the wing tip off. You can freeze these to make bone broth with later.
STEP 3
In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup Blackberry Chipotle Jam and 1/2 cup water. Whisk to combine, then add 2/3 marinade with the chicken wings and salt and pepper in a plastic bag. Let this sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
STEP 4
In the meantime, preheat oven to 400F. Once the chicken is finished marinating, lay on a cookie sheet with a wire rack on top. Bake for 15 minutes at 400F, then flip and turn oven up to 425F. Brush the remaining marinade over each wing (now the bottom side) and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until wings are crispy.
STEP 5
Remove from the oven, let cool, and enjoy!
