Southwestern pork stew  
Ingredients:
1 lb. Cooked Pork Shoulder, sliced (recipe here)
2 tsp. Chili Powder
2 tsp. Cumin
1 tsp. Minced Garlic
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
1 tsp. Paprika
1 tsp. Oregano
1/4 tsp. Cinnamon
2 Bay Leafs
6 oz. Button Mushrooms
1/2 sliced Jalapeno
1/2 medium Onion
1/2 Green Bell Pepper, sliced
1/2 Red Bell Pepper, sliced
Juice 1/2 Lime (to finish)

2 cup Chicken Broth
1/2 cup Strong Coffee
1/4 cup Tomato Paste
Method:
STEP 1
Prep all vegetables by slicing and chopping them.
STEP 2
Let your bone broth start to come to room temperature. This is my own bone broth that I made with the pork bones – I will post a recipe on this sometime in the future.
STEP 3
Bring a pan to high heat with 2 tbsp. Olive Oil. Once hot, add vegetables and saute them until they are slightly cooked and aromatic.
STEP 4
Measure out all spices into a small container so you can use them as needed.
STEP 5
Slice pork (I use the tougher meat for this) into bite size chunk
STEP 6
Add bone broth, chicken broth, and coffee to slow cooker.
STEP 7
Add pork and mushrooms to the slow cooker and mix together.
STEP 8
Add spices and vegetables (with oil) to the slow cooker. Mix together well, cover, and set on low for 4-10 hours.
STEP 9
Once it’s finished, take the lid off and stir together.
STEP 10
Serve it up!
