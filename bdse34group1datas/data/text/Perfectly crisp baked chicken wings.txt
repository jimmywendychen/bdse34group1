Perfectly crisp baked chicken wings 
Ingredients:
3 lbs. Chicken Wings, drumsticks and wings (~20 wings)
1/4 cup Butter
1 tsp. Baking Soda
2 tsp. Baking Powder
1 tbsp. Salt
Method:
STEP 1
Put all of your chicken wings into a plastic bag and mix together the baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
STEP 2
Pour all of the baking powder mixture into the bag with the chicken wings.
STEP 3
Shake the bag very well to make sure all of the wings are coated in the mixture.
STEP 4
Place all chicken wings on a wire rack and set in the fridge overnight. This helps dry them out and breaks down the peptide bonds in the proteins of the chicken (allowing for more crisp).
STEP 5
When you’re ready the next day, position a rack in the top middle position and pre-heat your oven to 450F. Once the oven is heated, place the chicken wings in and bake for 20 minutes.
STEP 6
Remove the chicken from the oven and flip the chicken wings. Bake again for 15 minutes or until very crisp.
STEP 7
Toss with your favorite wing sauce – butter and cilantro, butter and hot sauce (buffalo sauce), or make something fancier (like garlic parmesan sauce).
