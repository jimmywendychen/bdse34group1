BBQ bacon wrapped smokies
Ingredients:
24 Lit’l Smokies
6 slices Bacon
3 tbsp. Keto BBQ Sauce
Salt and Pepper to taste
Method:

Preheat oven to 375F. Start by chopping 6 slices of bacon into quarter-pieces. In total, you should have 24 quarter-slices of bacon. Place a little smokie on top of the slice of bacon.
STEP 2
Roll the little smokie up in the bacon so that there is a small amount of overlap.
STEP 3
Stick a toothpick into the overlapping piece and set on a cookie sheet covered with foil.
STEP 4
Repeat the process for all of the smokies and place into the oven to bake for 25 minutes.
STEP 5
Take the smokies out of the oven and use a basting brush to brush BBQ sauce on the little smokies. They should be coated quite well.
STEP 6
Place back in the oven and bake for another 10-12 minutes.
STEP 7
Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.
STEP 8
Serve on a platter. Feel free to sprinkle some parmesan cheese and chopped spring onion over them.
