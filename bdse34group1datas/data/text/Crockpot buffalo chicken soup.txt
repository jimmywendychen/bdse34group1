Crockpot buffalo chicken soup 
Ingredients:
3 medium Chicken Thighs, deboned and sliced (~1.2 lbs without bones)
1 tsp. Onion Powder
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp. Celery Seed
1/4 cup Butter
1/3 – 1/2 cup Frank’s Hot Sauce (depending on how spicy you like it)
3 cups Beef Broth
1 cup Heavy Cream
2 oz. Cream Cheese
1/4 tsp. Xanthan Gum
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
De-bone the chicken thighs (I find scissors are the easiest to do this with).
STEP 2
Cut or slice the chicken into chunks and drop them in the crockpot.
STEP 3
Add all the rest of the ingredients to the crockpot except for cream, cheese, and xanthan gum. Set crockpot on low for 6 hours (or high for 3 hours) and let cook completely.
STEP 4
Once everything is cooked, remove the chicken from the crockpot and shred using a fork.
STEP 5
Add cream, cheese, and xanthan gum to the crockpot. Using an immersion blender, emulsify all of the liquids together. This will help the soup from separating while you are eating.
STEP 6
Place the chicken back into the crockpot and stir together. Taste and season with extra salt, pepper, and hot sauce if you’d like.
STEP 7
Serve up and enjoy!
