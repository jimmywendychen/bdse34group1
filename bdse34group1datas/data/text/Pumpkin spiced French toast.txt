Pumpkin spiced French toast
Ingredients:
4 slices Pumpkin Bread
1 large Egg
2 tbsp. Cream
1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
1/8 tsp. Orange Extract
1/4 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice
2 tbsp. Butter
Method:
STEP 1
Dry out 4 slices of Pumpkin Bread (recipe here) for this recipe. You can leave the slices out overnight, uncovered to reach the desired dryness.
STEP 2
I made 2 batches with this, so the pictures show extra. In a small container, mix together your egg, cream, vanilla extract, orange extract, and pumpkin pie spice.
STEP 3
Dip the bread into the mixture and let it soak for about 5 minutes.
STEP 4
Flip the bread and allow to soak for 5 more minutes.
STEP 5
In a pan, set to medium-low heat and set butter in the middle. Let the butter cook until it starts to brown.
STEP 6
Once the butter is browned, add the bread that has now soaked almost all of the mixture. Let this cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side until finished.
STEP 7
Top with powdered swerve and/or keto maple syrup. Enjoy!
