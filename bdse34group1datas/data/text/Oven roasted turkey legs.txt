Oven roasted turkey legs 
Ingredients:
2 medium Turkey Legs (each leg ~1 lbs. without bone)
2 tbsp. Duck Fat (or peanut oil/other animal fat)
2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper
1/2 tsp. Onion Powder
1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp. Dried Thyme
1/2 tsp. Ancho Chili Powder
1 tsp. Liquid Smoke
1 tsp. Worcestershire
Method:
STEP 1
Mix together all dry spices in a small bowl. Then, add wet ingredients and mix together into a rub.
STEP 2
Pat turkey legs completely dry with paper towels. Then, rub turkey legs well with seasoning. 
STEP 3
Pre-heat oven to 350F. Bring 2 tbsp. of fat to medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet. Once the oil starts to smoke, add turkey legs into the pan and sear on each side for 1-2 minutes. You want the entire leg to have a sear on it.
STEP 4
Place in the oven at 350F for 50-60 minutes or until cooked through.
STEP 5
Remove turkey from the oven and let rest for a few minutes.
STEP 6
Serve with your favorite fatty side dish and enjoy the holiday meal! I served mine up with a slight variation on this Vegetable Medley – with plenty of duck fat and butter to be soaked up.
