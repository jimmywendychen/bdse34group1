Bacon cheddar chive omelette
Ingredients:
2 slices Bacon, already cooked
1 tsp. Bacon Fat
2 large Eggs
1 oz. Cheddar Cheese
2 stalks Chives
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Make sure that you have all of your ingredients ready to go as the omelette will cook quickly. Shred the cheese, pre-cook the bacon, and have the chives chopped (or use herb scissors if you’re lazy like me).
STEP 2
Heat a pan with bacon fat in it to medium-low heat. You want it emitting a decent amount of heat when you hover your hand above the pan. Add the eggs, and season with chives, salt, and pepper.
STEP 3
Once the edges are starting to set, add your bacon to the center and let cook for 20-30 seconds longer. Then, turn the heat off on the stove.
STEP 4
Add the cheese on top of the bacon, making sure it’s centered. Then, take two edges of the omelette and fold them onto the cheese. Hold the edges there for a moment as the cheese has to partially melt to act as a “glue” to hold them in place.
STEP 5
Do the same with the other edges, creating a burrito of sorts, then flip over and let cook in the now warm pan for a little longer.
STEP 6
Serve with a bit of extra cheese, bacon, and chives on top if you’d like – but by itself it’s just plain delicious.
