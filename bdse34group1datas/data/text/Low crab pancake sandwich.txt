Low crab pancake sandwich
Ingredients:
The Pancake Bun
0.75 oz. Pork Rinds
1 tbsp. Almond Flour
1 large Egg, beaten
1 tbsp. Heavy Cream
1/4 tsp. Vanilla Extract
2 tbsp. Maple Syrup
The Filling
2 oz. Hot Sausage
1 slice Cheddar Cheese
1 large Egg
Method:
STEP 1
Measure out 2 Oz. Sausage and set aside. You can use a silicone ring mold from Amazon to help with the whole process to keep everything the same size.
STEP 2
Grind pork rinds in a food processor until a powder is formed.
STEP 3
Heat a pan to medium high heat on the stove. Add sausage in ring mold and cook until medium-well temperature. Once cooked, set aside in some foil to rest.
STEP 4
While the sausage is cooking, mix together pork rinds with all bun ingredients.
STEP 5
Put an egg ring mold inside the pan and fill 3/4 of the way with bun batter (this should be half of the batter).
STEP 6
Once the bun is browned on the bottom, remove the ring mold and flip to the other side. Cook until this side is also browned. Repeat the process with the other half of the batter to create another bun.
STEP 7
In the same pan, add an egg to the ring mold and lightly scramble. Cook completely until solidified.
STEP 8
Assemble together with 1 bun on bottom, 1 slice of cheese, hot egg, sausage, and the last bun on top. Then, serve!
