Keto pumpkin pie spice latte
Ingredients:
2 cups Coffee, strong and fresh brewed
1 cup Coconut Milk(from the carton)
1/4 cup Pumpkin Puree
2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice Blend (recipe here)
1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
1 tsp. Vanilla Extract
2 tbsp. Heavy Whipping Cream
2 tbsp. Butter
15 drops Liquid Stevia
Method:
STEP 1
In a pot over medium-low heat, add the pumpkin, butter, coconut milk, and spices.
STEP 2
While the pumpkin mixture is coming together, brew 2 cups worth of strong coffee. I use a Keurig machine to do this.
STEP 3
Once the pumpkin mixture is starting to get hot and bubble slightly, mix it together.
STEP 4
Stir in your 2 cups of strong coffee well.
STEP 5
Add stevia and heavy cream. Take an immersion blender to it and blend it well over the stove-top.
STEP 6
Add a little extra whipped cream on top with a pinch more spice. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your morning!
