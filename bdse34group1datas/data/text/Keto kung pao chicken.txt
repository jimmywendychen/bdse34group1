Keto kung pao chicken 
Ingredients:
2 medium Chicken Thighs, bone in skin on
1 tsp. Ground Ginger
Salt and Pepper to Taste
1/4 cup Peanuts
1/2 medium Green Pepper
2 large Spring Onions
4 red Bird’s Eye Chilis, de-seeded
The Sauce
1 tbsp. Soy Sauce
2 tsp. Rice Wine Vinegar
2 tbsp. Chili Garlic Paste
1 tbsp. Reduced Sugar
Ketchup
2 tsp. Sesame Oil
1/2 tsp. Maple Extract
10 drops Liquid Stevia
Method:
STEP 1
Debone chicken using kitchen shears. Cut chicken into bite sized pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and ground ginger.
STEP 2
Heat a pan over medium-high heat and once very hot, add chicken. Let chicken cook until browned (about 10 minutes). I advise using a splatter screen or covering the pan with paper towels as there will be grease splash-back.
STEP 3
Chop up and prep vegetables and chilis. Set aside.
STEP 4
Prepare sauce by combining all ingredients together and mixing well.
STEP 5
Once the chicken is browned, stir everything together and let cook for a few minutes more. Add vegetables and peanuts to the pan and allow to cook down (about 3-4 minutes).
STEP 6
Add sauce to the pan and let it boil down to reduce slightly. It should have almost a sticky texture once done.
STEP 7
Serve on top of your favorite side dish. For us, it’s fried cauliflower rice!
