Jalapeno popper mug cake 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp. Almond Flour
1 tbsp. Golden Flaxseed Meal
1 tbsp. Butter
1 tbsp. Cream Cheese
1 large Egg
1 slice Bacon, cooked
1/2 medium Jalapeno Pepper
1/2 tsp. Baking Powder
1/4 tsp. Salt 
Method:
STEP 1
In a pan over medium heat, cook the sliced bacon until crisp. 
STEP 2
Once bacon is crisp, remove from the pan and set aside. 
STEP 3
In a container or a mug, mix together all of the ingredients. I like to add the bacon fat to this, but that will add extra fat macros – so make sure it fits into your macros. I find that it helps bring the bacon taste out more. 
STEP 4
Clean off the sides of the container so that there is no excess batter running up the sides. 
STEP 5
Microwave for 75 seconds on high (power level 10). 
STEP 6
Lightly slam cup against plate to take the mug cake out. Garnish with extra jalapeno and serve.
