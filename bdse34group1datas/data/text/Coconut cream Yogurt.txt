Coconut cream Yogurt 
Ingredients:
1 can Full Fat Coconut Milk
2 capsules NOW Probiotic- 10
1/2 tsp. NOW Xanthan Gum (1/4 tsp. split between both
jars)
2/3 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
Toppings of Your Choice
Method:
STEP 1
Open a can of coconut milk and stir it well. You want to make sure the cream and water in the can is thoroughly mixed.
STEP 2
Put the coconut milk into whatever container you’d like. I seperated mine into 200mL mason jars. Have your NOW Probiotic-10 handy.
STEP 3
Break the capsules into the coconut milk. If you are using 2 jars, use 1 capsule per jar. If you are using 1 jar, use 2 capsules. Stir the mixture together well and place the lids on the jar.
STEP 4
Turn your oven light on and place the jars in the oven. Close the oven door, keeping the light on, and let it sit for 12-24 hours overnight. The longer the bacteria can culture, the thicker the mixture will get, but it doesn’t make too big of a difference.
STEP 5
Empty all of your yogurt into a mixing bowl and sprinkle 1/2 tsp. Xanthan gum over it. Using a hand mixer, mix this well.
STEP 6
In a separate bowl, whip up 2/3 cup heavy cream until stiff peaks form. You want this to be solid cream almost. 
STEP 7
Dump the solid cream into the yogurt and mix on a low speed until the consistency you want is achieved.
STEP 8
Add toppings, flavorings, or fillings of your choice and enjoy!
