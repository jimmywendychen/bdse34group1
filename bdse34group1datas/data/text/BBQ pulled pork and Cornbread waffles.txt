BBQ pulled pork and Cornbread waffles 
Ingredients:
16 OZ. Pulled Pork
1 cup Almond Flour
1 tsp. Baking Powder
1/2 tsp. Salt
3 large Eggs
2 tbsp. Butter
1/4 cup Sour Cream
2 tbsp. Golden Flaxseed Meal
1 tbsp. Psyllium Husk Powder
1/4 cup Coconut Milk(from carton)
2 tbsp. Chopped Red Pepper
1/4 cup BBQ Sauce 
Method:
STEP 1
Start by making the BBQ sauce recipe found on the site. I add a little bit of lime for an extra acidic note to mine.
STEP 2
Mix together all of the ingredients except for the pulled pork. Add dry ingredients first, then wet. Once the batter comes together, add your red pepper.
STEP 3
Pour batter into your waffle maker. I use this Waffle Maker as I prefer the square waffles that can pull apart and be made into different size servings.
STEP 4
Once the waffle maker tells you that it’s ready, take the waffles out and lay on a paper towels.
STEP 5
While the waffle is cooking, put pulled pork into a pan and medium-low heat. Add about 3 tbsp. BBQ sauce and stir in.
STEP 6
Once your waffles are ready, your pulled pork should be heated through and ready to serve.
STEP 7
Add pulled pork to the top of your waffle and add a little more BBQ sauce.
STEP 8
Optionally, serve with extra sour cream and a slice of a fresh jalapeno for a pop of flavor and spice.
