Jalapeno popper egg cups
Ingredients:
12 strips Bacon
8 large Eggs
4 oz. Cheddar Cheese
3 oz. Cream Cheese
4 medium Jalapeno Peppers, deseeded and chopped
1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp. Onion Powder
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Get all ingredients ready. Measure out all cheese and grate as needed. Prep the jalapenos by seeding and chopping them. Save 1 jalapeno that you can cut into rings as a garnish for the top. Preheat oven to 375F.
STEP 2
Par-cook bacon so it’s semi crisp but still pliable. Save bacon grease in the pan.
STEP 3
Using a hand mixer, mix together eggs, cream cheese, chopped and seeded jalapeno peppers, leftover bacon grease, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt and pepper to taste.
STEP 4
Grease wells of muffin tin, then place par-cooked bacon around the edges.
STEP 5
Pour egg mixture into the wells of the muffin tin. Make sure you only go about half-way to 2/3 way up as they rise quite a lot. Oh! This is the reason you only see 4 muffins in the following pictures – I overfilled the first batch of 12 and they turned into Frankenstein muffins.
STEP 6
Add cheddar cheese on the top of the muffin, then a jalapeno. Cook at 375F for 20-25 minutes.
STEP 7
Once cooked, remove from the oven to let cool. They will slowly deflate and give you a great treat.
STEP 8
Serve and enjoy!
