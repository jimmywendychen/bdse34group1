Salmon with tarragon dill cream sauce 
Ingredients:
Salmon Filets
1 1/2 lb. Salmon Filet
3/4-1 tsp. Dried Tarragon
3/4-1 tsp. Dried Dill Weed
1 tbsp. Duck Fat
Salt and Pepper to Taste Cream Sauce
2 tbsp. Butter
1/4 cup Heavy Cream
1/2 tsp. Dried Tarragon
1/2 tsp. Dried Dill Weed
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Slice the salmon in half to create 2 1/4 lb. filets. Season meat of fish with tarragon, dill weed, and salt and pepper. Turn around and season skin with salt and pepper only.
STEP 2
Heat 1 tbsp. duck fat in a ceramic cast iron skillet over medium heat (or any pan that will hold heat well). Once hot, add salmon skin side down.
STEP 3
Allow salmon to cook for 4-6 minutes while skin crisps up. Once the skin is crisp, reduce to low heat and flip salmon.
STEP 4
Cook salmon until done-ness you want is achieved. Generally about 7-15 minutes over low heat.
Optional: If desired, cook on sides for 20-40 seconds to get darker edges.
STEP 5
Remove salmon from the pan and set aside. Add butter and spices to the pan and let brown. Once browned, add cream mix together.
STEP 6
Serve with broccoli or asparagus (or your favorite side dish) and be generous with cream sauce. Garnish with a small amount of red pepper flakes.
