Ham and cheese keto stromboli 
Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups Mozzarella Cheese, shredded
4 tbsp. Almond Flour
3 tbsp. Coconut Flour
1 large Egg
1 tsp. Italian Seasoning
4 oz. Ham
3.5 oz. Cheddar Cheese
Salt and Pepper to Taste 
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat your oven to 400F and in a microwave or toaster oven, melt your mozzarella cheese. About 1 minute in the microwave, and 10 second intervals afterward, or about 10 minutes in an oven, stirring occasionally. 
STEP 2
Combine almond and coconut flour, as well as your seasonings in a mixing bowl. I used salt, pepper and an Italian blend seasoning. 
STEP 3
When the mozzarella is melted, place that into your flour mixture and begin working it in.  
STEP 4
After about a minute, when the cheese has had a chance to cool down a bit, add in your egg and combine everything together. It helps to use two utensils here. 
STEP 5
When everything is combined and you’ve got a moist dough, transfer it to a flat surface with some parchment paper. 
STEP 6
Lay a second sheet of parchment paper over the dough ball and use a rolling pin or your hand to flatten it out. 
STEP 7
Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut diagonal lines beginning from the edges of the dough to the center, leave a row of dough untouched about 4 inches wide.
STEP 8
Alternate laying ham and cheddar on that uncut stretch of dough.
STEP 9
Then lift one section of dough at a time and lay it over the top, covering your filling.
STEP 10
Then bake it for about 15-20 minutes until you see it has turned a golden brown color.
STEP 11
Slice it up and serve!
