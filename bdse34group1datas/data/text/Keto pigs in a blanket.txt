Keto pigs in a blanket
Ingredients:
37 Lit’l Smokies
8 oz. Cheddar Cheese (~2 cups)
3/4 cup Almond Flour
1 tbsp. Psyllium Husk Powder
1.5 oz. Cream Cheese (~3 tbsp.)
1 large Egg
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
Method:
STEP 1
Measure out the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients.
STEP 2
Start by melting the cheddar cheese in the microwave. Go in 20 second intervals and stir to make sure the melting is even. once it’s fully melted and slightly bubbling on the outside, it is ready.
STEP 3
While the cheddar is still hot, mix together all of the ingredients to make the dough.
STEP 4
Spread the dough out on a silpat until it fills the entire sheet. Make sure it is even.
STEP 5
Place dough in the fridge to harden up for 15-20 minutes. Pre-heat your oven to 400F while you do this.
STEP 6
Once the dough is cold, transfer to foil to cut. You should never use knives on your silpat.
STEP 7
Slice the dough into strips and wrap around the Lit’l Smokies. Then bake for 13-15 minutes. Before taking them out, you can additionally broil them for 1-2 minutes.
STEP 8
Serve while warm. A sauce that is acidic and slightly sweet would work very well.
