The Bread
2 cups Mozzarella Cheese
3/4 cup Almond Flour
1 tbsp. Psyllium Husk Powder
3 tbsp. Cream Cheese
1 large Egg
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper Omelette
1 tbsp. Coconut Oil
1/2 small Onion, diced
1 clove Garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp. Water
1/4 tsp. Curry Powder
4 tbsp. Ground Beef
Salt and Pepper to Taste
2 1/2 tbsp. Unsalted Butter
2 large Eggs
2 tbsp. chopped Green Onion
2 tbsp. chopped Cilantro
2 tbsp. Mayonnaise (optional)
2 tbsp. Reduced Sugar Ketchup (or favorite sauce, optional)
5 slices Cucumber (garnish)
3 slices Tomatoes (garnish)
1 piece Butter Lettuce (garnish)
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat oven to 400F. Follow the pizza base recipe for Low Carb Pepperoni Pizza, exclude the Italian Seasoning. Divide the dough into two. Shape each dough into a long bun, making sure both will fit on a large pan. Bake for about 30-40 minutes.
STEP 2
While waiting, preheat a pan on medium heat. Add in 1 tbsp. Coconut Oil. Once melted, saute the diced Onion. Once the onion turns translucent, add in the chopped Garlic. After 1 minute, add in 1/4 tsp. Curry Powder and 1 tsp. Water. Let the curry powder cook for 2 minutes.
STEP 3
Add in 4 tbsp. Ground Beef and cook until brown. Season with Salt and Pepper to taste. It should be cooked in such a way you would eat this on its own.
STEP 4
When the buns are ready, remove the buns from the oven. Cool both buns on a cooling rack. The buns should deflate a bit.
STEP 5
Once the buns become cool enough, slice them horizontally but not completely. Spread about 1/2 tbsp. of Unsalted Butter onto both buns.
STEP 6
Toast the buttered side of the buns with a pan.
STEP 7
In a mixing bowl, crack an egg. Add in about half of the cooked Ground Beef, 1 tbsp. each Green Onion and Cilantro. Season with a bit of Salt and Pepper. Mix well.
STEP 8
Preheat a large pan on medium heat. Melt 1 tbsp. of Unsalted Butter. Than, add in the omelette mixture to the pan.
STEP 9
Immediately cover the omelette with a bun.
STEP 10
When the omelette is cooked (after about 2-3 minutes), flip and toast the bun side until brown.
STEP 11
Remove from the pan and spread about 1 tbsp. of Mayonnaise and Reduced Sugar Ketchup (or any kinds of sauce) onto the omelette side. Garnish with some sliced Cucumber and Tomatoes, and Lettuce. Repeat steps 7-10 for the other bun.
STEP 12
Fold the buns and serve while hot!
