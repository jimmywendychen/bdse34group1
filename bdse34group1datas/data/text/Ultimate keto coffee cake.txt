Ultimate keto coffee cake 
Ingredients:
Base
6 Large Eggs, Separated
6 Oz. Cream Cheese
1/4 Cup Erythritol
1/4 tsp. Liquid Stevia
1/4 Cup Unflavored Protein Powder
2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
1/4 tsp. Cream of Tartar Filling
1 1/2 Cup Almond Flour
1 Tbsp. Cinnamon
1/2 Stick Butter
1/4 Cup Maple Syrup
1/4 Cup Erythritol
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat your oven to 325F. If you’re using a glass baking dish, use 300F.
STEP 2
Seperate the eggs from the egg whites for all 5 eggs. Cream together the egg yolks with 1/4 Cup Erythritol and 1/4 tsp. Liquid Stevia.
STEP 3
Once the egg yolks are creamed, add 6 Oz. Cream cheese and 1/4 Cup Unflavored Protein Powder. Mix this together well until a thick batter forms.
STEP 4
Beat your egg whites together with the 1/4 tsp. Cream of Tartar until stiff peaks form.
STEP 5
Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, doing 1/2 of the egg whites first and then the other half. Pour the batter into a round cake pan.
STEP 6
Mix together all of the “Filling” ingredients: 1 1/2 Cup Almond Flour, 1 Tbsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 Stick Butter, 1/4 Cup Maple Syrup (recipe here), and 1/4 Cup Erythritol. This should form a “dough” of sorts. Take half and rip off little pieces to top the cake – push the pieces down if they don’t sink on their own.
STEP 7
Bake for 20 minutes and then top with the rest of the cinnamon filling. Bake for another 20-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool for 20 minutes before removing from the cake pan.
