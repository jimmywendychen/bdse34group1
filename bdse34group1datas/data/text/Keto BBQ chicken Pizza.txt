Keto BBQ chicken Pizza
Ingredients:
Dairy Free Pizza Crust
6 large Eggs
6 tbsp. Parmesan Cheese (omit for 2 tsp. coconut flour if going dairy free)
3 tbsp. Psyllium Husk Powder
1 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Toppings
4 oz. Cheddar Cheese
6 oz. Rotisserie Chicken, shredded
1 tbsp. Mayonnaise
4 tbsp. BBQ Sauce
4 tbsp. Rao’s Tomato Sauce
Method:
STEP 1
Pre-heat oven to 425F and shred cheese. Set aside.
STEP 2
Using an immersion blender, combine all ingredients for the crust until very well mixed. It should be rather thick.
STEP 3
Spread dough out on a silpat using a silicone spatula. It’s too sticky to use your hands for (I tried it and it was a mess). Silicone really helps keep the dough from sticking on to everything. This will take you a few minutes to do, but your oven should be pre-heating in the meantime.
STEP 4
Once the crust is spread out evenly, place in the oven and bake on the top rack for 10 minutes.
STEP 5
Once done in the oven, flip the pizza over. I tried flipping it with a flipper, but ended up using my hands by holding 2 corners.
STEP 6
Top with your favorite toppings, then broil for an additional 3 minutes in the oven.
STEP 7
Slice and serve! Feel free to top with chives, spring onion, or other herbs vegetables that match the toppings.
