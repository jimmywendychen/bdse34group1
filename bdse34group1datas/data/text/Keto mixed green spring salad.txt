Keto mixed green spring salad 
Ingredients:
2 OZ. Mixed Greens
3 tbsp. Pine Nuts, roasted
2 tbsp. 5 Minute Keto Raspberry Vinaigrette
2 tbsp. Shaved Parmesan
2 slices Bacon
Salt and Pepper to taste
Method:
STEP 1
Cook bacon until very crisp. I let mine slightly burn on the edges to give the salad a slight addition in bitter notes in some bites.
STEP 2
Measure out your greens and set in a container that can be shaken.
STEP 3
Crumble bacon, then add the rest of the ingredients to the greens. Shake the container with a lid on to distribute the dressing and contents evenly.
STEP 4
Serve and enjoy!
