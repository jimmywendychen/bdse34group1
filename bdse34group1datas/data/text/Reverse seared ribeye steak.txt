Reverse seared ribeye steak 
Ingredients:
2 medium Ribeye Steaks(~1.2 lbs.)
3 tbsp. Bacon Fat (or other high smoke point oil)
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat oven to 250F. Put your steaks on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet. Season heavily with salt and pepper on all sides of the meat.
STEP 2
Stick an instant-read thermometer through the side of the steak so that the tip reaches the middle. Set thermometer for 123F internal temperature and bake in the oven until internal temperature is reached. About 40-45 minutes.
STEP 3
Let the steaks rest for a few minutes. Usually only a few minutes. The juices won’t run as much with this method because it’s cooking low and slow, rather than a fast sear.
STEP 4
Heat the bacon grease in a cast iron skillet or cermic cast iron skillet and wait until the pan is very hot. I normally wait until the smoke point of the grease is hit. Place the steaks in and sear for 30 – 45 seconds on each side.
STEP 5
Don’t forget to sear the sides of the steak!
STEP 6
Let rest for 2-3 minutes and serve warm. Enjoy! Feel free to serve up with some awesome and super Easy Creamy Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes.
