Spicy jalapeno poppers
Ingredients:
5 OZ. Cream Cheese
1/4 cup Mozzarella Cheese
8 medium Jalapeno Peppers
1/4 tsp. Salt
1/4 tsp. Pepper
1/2 tsp. Mrs. Dash Table Blend
8 slices Bacon
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat oven to 400F. Wash all of your jalapeno peppers (for this, I am using 8 peppers). Foil a baking sheet and remove the stems of your peppers.
STEP 2
Slice each pepper in half, making sure that it is an even cut on each pepper.
STEP 3
Using a spoon, scrape out all of the guts of the peppers. You can leave a few seeds inside for extra heat if you’d like.
STEP 4
In a bowl, combine 5 oz. Cream Cheese, 1/4 cup Mozzarella Cheese, and spices of your choice. I used 1/4 tsp. Salt, 1/4 tsp. Pepper, and 1/2 tsp. Mrs. Dash Table Blend.
STEP 5
Pack the cream cheese mixture into each pepper, creating a mound that the other half will fit on top of.
STEP 6
Press the other half of the peppers into the cream cheese mixture, closing the peppers up like they were never cut.
STEP 7
Wrap each pepper in bacon, starting from the bottom and working your way up to the top.
STEP 8
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until bacon begins it crisp up and is cooked completely. Broil for additional 2-3 minutes to get a darker color and more crisp on the bacon.
STEP 9
Serve up – I served with a saute of broccoli, red pepper, and celery in the leftover bacon fat from the baking sheet.
