Perfect ribeye steak
Ingredients:
16 oz. Ribeye Steak (1 – 1 1/4 inch thick)
1 tbsp. Duck Fat (or other high smoke point oil like Peanut Oil)
1 tbsp. Butter
1/2 tsp. Thyme, chopped
Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat oven to 400F. Put your cast iron skillet in the oven while it’s cold so that the cast iron heats with the oven.
STEP 2
Prep your steak by rubbing with light coating of duck fat or oil. Then, apply a healthy coating of salt and pepper on all sides including the edges.
STEP 3
Once the oven is pre-heated, remove the cast iron skillet and place on the stove top over medium heat. Add duck fat, or oil, and put your steak into the pan and let sear. Do this for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
STEP 4
Flip the steak and put into the oven immediately for 4-6 minutes (depending on doneness – 4 minutes for medium-rare). Prepare for a bit of smoke to happen as the pan is very hot – but once it goes back into the oven, it should cool down slightly and stop smoking.
STEP 5
Measure out 2 tbsp. butter and 1/2 tsp. chopped thyme.
STEP 6
Take the steak out of the oven and place on the stove top over low heat. Add the butter to the pan and base the steak with the butter. Push the handle of the cast iron downward (you may need something to protect your hand) and scoop the butter up with a spoon, ladling it over the steak. Do this for 2-4 minutes depending on doneness you want.
STEP 7
Place in foil or cover, and let rest for 5 minutes.
STEP 8
Serve up with your favorite veggies and extra butter if you’d like!
